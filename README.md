## Active Collab Timer

Way better than the official app.

### TODOs

- Detect when logged out, and make the user sign in again. Ping every 30 seconds.
- Allow saving of defaults using localstorage/vuex-persist.
- Link to projects/tasks from time listing.
- Allow user to edit time records.

### Notes

- No client auth, use config file to do it python-side.
- Currently only gets the last month of time records.
